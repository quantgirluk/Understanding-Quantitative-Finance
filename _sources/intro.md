# Welcome

This is a collection of notes exploring a number of topics in Quantitative Finance (QF). The idea is to use [Python](https://www.python.org) &#x1F40D;to illustrate the theoretical concepts and help you to get a better understaing of each topic. My aim is to provide an open-source repository where people interested in a career in QF can find all these concepts covered in a rigorous manner but also including a practitioners point of view.
