# Welcome

This is a collection of notes exploring a number of topics in Quantitative Finance (QF).

The idea is to use [Python](https://www.python.org) to illustrate the theoretical concepts and get a better understaing of each topic.

My aim is to create an open-source repository where people interested in a career in QF can find all these concepts covered in a rigorous manner but also including a practicioners point of view.
