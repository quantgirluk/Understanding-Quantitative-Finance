# Welcome 👋🏽

This is a collection of notes exploring topics in Quantitative Finance (QF).

The idea is to use [Python](https://www.python.org) &#x1F40D;to illustrate the theoretical concepts and get a better understaing of each topic. My aim is to create an open-source repository &#x1F4D8; where people interested in a career in QF can find all these concepts covered in a rigorous manner but also including a practitioners point of view.
